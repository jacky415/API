API information

REST - “Representational State Transfer”. 
REST determines how the API looks like. 
It's a set of rules that devs follow when creating their API. 
One rule states that you should get a piece of data, called a resource, when you link to a specific URL. 
Each URL is called a request, while the data we get back is called a response.
